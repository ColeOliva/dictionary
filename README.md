# dictionary

yep, you heard it. It's a dictionary app. that's all we got. pretty straightforward, you can search up words (using API (link in backend folder readme)), save your favorite words (wowza!),
and even listen to the audio of it (only for select words... if the audio is not present in the API grab it will throw an error)!

to use run ```./start.sh```. this only starts frontend and backend, and doesn't install any dependencies, so there's a solid chance it won't work. I just didn't want to be installing
anything on someone's device if they unknowingly ran this. use ```npm install``` in both frontend and backend directories to install dependencies.
